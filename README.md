# tiptap-commonmark
> A starter-kit for [the tiptap editor](https://tiptap.dev), based on [CommonMark](https://spec.commonmark.org/0.30/)

## About
This package bundles a bunch of basic tiptap extensions. It's like tiptap's [official starter-kit](https://tiptap.dev/api/extensions/starter-kit), except that it's based on [the CommonMark specification](https://spec.commonmark.org/0.30/).

Note that this extension cannot read or write markdown. For that, you can use [`tiptap-markdown`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/tiptap-markdown).
